  2. This also contains the code (Rmd) to process flu data for
     Comparison
     
  3. I replicated Bob Rudis' analysis
  
  4. I processed a recreation of the Fox News plot. Some data is in
     the `frs` folder.

## Some Interesting resources

- A thoughtful critique of modeling by journalist and author Alex Berenson
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG2vdyfLv7U). Berenson's wife is a
pysician and has treted COVID patients. A short summary: the
models by Niall Ferguson were significant over predictions. He has a 
history of such predictions.  There were also problems with the predictions
of the University of Washington model. This was revised, but at the time
of revision the revised estimate was still significantlty higher than the
obseved case in both Washington and NYC.
