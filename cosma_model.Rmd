Whoa! What happened?

But, yes, of course! A third-degree polynomial doesn’t just go up, then
down. It goes up, then down, then up. Here’s the fitted polynomial in
question:

```{r summaryCubic, comment=NA}
summary(cubic)
```

The coefficient of x^3 is positive, so indeed the function has to blow
up to infinity once x is big enough. (It blows up to negative infinity
for sufficiently low values of x, but since we’re exponentiating to get
the prediction back on the original scale, that just sends the fitted
curve to zero.)

When I went back and fit the third-degree model just to the data before
5 May, I got this:

```

                            coef.est coef.se
(Intercept)                  5.57     0.07  
poly(weeks_since_apr_1, 3)1 17.97     0.52  
poly(weeks_since_apr_1, 3)2 -8.54     0.52  
poly(weeks_since_apr_1, 3)3 -0.97     0.52  
---
n = 63, k = 4
residual sd = 0.52, R-Squared = 0.96
```

Now the highest-degree coefficient estimate is negative, so the curve
will continue declining to 0 as x increases. It would retrospectively
blow up for low enough values of x, but this is not a problem as we’re
only going forward in time with our forecasts.
